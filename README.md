First task of Android's course from Udemy website

The goal here is to get a 3-page application, sharing information
between every *activity* (explicit and implicit **Intent** objetcs)
- You must first your name
- Second, you must select a type of greeting and your age (there are some validations here!)
- Check the generated message and share it in your Social Networks (or whatever)
 
I tried to following certain patterns as Clean Code Book with meaningful names, list down pattern (as newspapers).
 
# Usage

Copy it and build with Android Studio. 

Enjoy!
